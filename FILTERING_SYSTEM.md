## Implementation Details

### Data Structure
The filtering system works with the existing member data structure:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Student Name",
  "department": "Computer Science",
  "role": "Full Stack Developer",
  "bio": "Description with keywords...",
  "github": "https://github.com/username",
  "linkedin": "https://linkedin.com/in/username"
}
```

### Filtering Logic
1. **Text Search**: Searches across name, department, role, and bio fields
2. **Department Filter**: Exact match on department field
3. **Role Filter**: Exact match on role field
4. **Combined Logic**: All conditions must be true (AND logic)

### Performance Optimizations
- **useMemo**: Expensive filtering operations are memoized
- **Debouncing**: Search input changes are optimized
- **Smart Re-renders**: Only re-renders when necessary
- **Efficient Algorithms**: Fast filtering even with large member lists

## Visual Design

### Color Coding

- **Department Tags**: Blue theme
- **Role Tags**: Green theme
- **Active Filters**: Primary color highlighting
- **Clear Actions**: Subtle red for removal actions
